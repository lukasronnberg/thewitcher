    <h3 id="gof" class="heading" style="padding-top: 0px">Geralt of Rivia</h3> <!-- Rubriken -->
    <p class="mainText"> <!-- Paragraftext -->
    Geralt of Rivia is a fictional character and the protagonist of The Witcher series of short
    stories and novels by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski.<br>
    Geralt, one of the few remaining witchers on the Continent, is a traveling monster slayer for hire,
    mutated and trained from an early age to slay deadly beasts.<br>
    Geralt is portrayed by Henry Cavill in The Witcher: TV series<br> <br>
    Geralt is a witcher. Shortly after being born, Geralt's mother, Visenna, gave him away to undergo training and, eventually,
    become a witcher at Kaer Morhen - the stronghold of the witchers.<br> Geralt survived mutations during the Trial of the
    Grasses, thanks to which he gained various witcher traits:</p>
    <!-- Lista -->
    <ul style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;">
    <li>high resistance to injury, poison and disease,</li>
    <li>slowed ageing, </li>
    <li>but also infertility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mainText"> <!-- Paragraftext -->
    He resisted the "changes" brought on by the Trial of Grasses better than most,
    which encouraged his makers to perform even more dangerous experimental procedures on him,<br> making him lose all body
    pigmentation. Because of his pale skin and white hair, he is also known in the Elder Speech as
    "Gwynbleidd" the White Wolf.<br> From the arduous training of Witchers,
    he became a master swordfighter and learnt how to use the Signs, simple spells used by the witchers.<br>

    accepting the fact and tries various methods of restoring her fertility. Yennefer ends up becoming a mother to Ciri while
    teaching her and watching over her while she was at Ellander.<br><br>
    Yennefer was famous for her beauty, even though during the events of The Swallow's Tower, she was 94 years old.<br>

    black hair.<br> Before becoming a sorceress, she was a hunchback, but had her deformities fixed by Tissaia de Vries while

    At the end of the books, Yennefer ends up dying while trying to heal Geralt, after losing all her energy.<br>
